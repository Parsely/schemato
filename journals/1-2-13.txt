Schemato journal
jan 2, 2013

Today is a day off, but I decided to be productive and work on schemato anyway

I noticed that semanticweb.org, who recently implemented rnews in rdfa, was
causing failed validations: the rnews predicates were not being recognized by
the validator class. I noticed that opengraph predicate qnames (like og:title)
were apparently automatically expanded to their absolute counterparts (like
http://ogp.me#title or whatever)

For whatever reason internal to pyrdfa, this automatic expansion wasn't
happening for rnews qnames. This is possibly becuase unlike og, rnews is not
a namespace that is added to new Graphs by default.

So i wrote the expand_qname function to perform this expansion when it doesn't
happen by default. Having an expanded name allows the class and predicate
validations to proceed properly.

However, I noticed another problem: semanticweb.org uses the rdfa
implemenations of both rnews and schema.org (for example,
<span property="schema:creator rnews:creator" typeof="schema:Person rnews:Person">
note the multiple types)

It seems that internally, the pyrdfa graph is arbitrarily choosing which of
these two types (schema:Person and rnews:Person) it should attribute to the object
that is the "creator" of the piece. As a result, sometimes the rnews
validation succeeds, and other times it fails due to its ontology not
containing any info on the "schema" namespace.

I need to look further into this arbitration.

Implemented schema caching on the server-side
The schema definition file is read from a local file
it is only pulled from the web if this local file is old or missing
This speeds up the average validation quite a bit
