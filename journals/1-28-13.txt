schemato progress, jan 28 2013

today I focused on fixing up the old broken Flask service that should run
schemato in a browser. I decided the best course of action was to code it to
work entirely separately from the module itself, such that a simple import
could handle it.

To this end, I figured out how to *manually* install the module in my
virtualenv. Steps are reproduced here for posterity.

- symlink the top-level module directory from [venv]/src
    like [venv]/src/schemato -> /home/emmett/git/CT/schemato/
- add a line to [venv]/lib/pythonx.x/site-packages/easy_install.pth
referencing that link
    like [venv]/src/schemato

Once I had done that, there were a few relative imports that had to be changed
with the assumption that the module would now be run from the current python
instance (virtualenv). See this commit for an example of this.

At this point, I have the celery service and web server working properly. It
seems that the next step should be to adjust the web frontend to accept the
new ouput format from the validator
