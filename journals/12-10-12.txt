Schemato bugfixes
December 10th

Since last week I was bothered by the problem that schemato seemed to be
having where it would fail to correctly validate fields that use one of the
nonstandard opengraph namespaces ("http://opengraphprotocol.org/schema"), for
example http://opengraphprotocol.org/schema/description.

Things I noticed:
opengraphprotocol.org/schema redirects to ogp.me
ogp.me is the only og: namespace expansion listed in the official turtle standard
the new york times correctly includes opengraphprotocol.org in their xmlns
opengraphprotocol.org appears in rdf_graph.namespaces()

The last one bothered me for a bit. After doing a bunch of digging in the
pyrdfa source, I found that a pyrdfa graph is automatically populated with
a bunch of default namespace/prefix pairs, including ogp.me.

opengraphprotocol.org appears in namespaces() because although it's not in these
defaults, it is properly listed in the document's xmlns.

Then the problem is this: nytimes uses a namespace prefix that is *not* in the
official standard, but is one that *I* know to be at least marginally
allowable by a validator. Then, how do we allow this nonstandard namespace
through while warning that it might not be standard?

Answer:
Maintain a list of nonstandard but still allowed namespace prefixes for each
standard. When validating an attribute, first strip it of its namespace
prefix, leaving just the field name (eg
http://opengraphprotocol.org/schema/url -> url). See if this field name is
found in the list of official attributes. If it is, check for the namespace's
presence in the list of allowed namespaces.

This solution allows valid fields and differentiates standard namespaces from
"allowed, but nonstandard" namespaces.
