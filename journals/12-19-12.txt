Schemato development
december 19, 2012

Today I was going through some TODOs and found some low-hanging fruit to grab.
Specifically, the log level was being hardcoded, and adding an __init__ kwarg
that allows the user to select a level was simple enough.

Also, I wanted to remove the hardcoding of the validator list that existed in
schemato.py. The goal was to read module paths from a settings file and import
all of the referenced validators.

This was a simple matter of splitting paths on '.', importing the package, and
then using getattr() to extract the module from the imported package. To make
this code nice and clean, all of the validator subclasses needed the same
signature, so I decided to add the url kwarg to all of them (opengraph had
included it for some reason). With this kwarg in place, the importing and
instantiation of the appropriate validator modules can be completed within
a 3-line for-loop. This also puts the list of validators in a more intuitive
location in the codebase.
